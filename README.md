**For this checkpoint, you will be recreating the shopping cart created in the superskill, JavaScript and the DOM. This time, the code previously written will be rewritten using the Object Oriented JavaScript (OOJ) approach.**

1-Create an object class for the product to store the properties for id, name and price of the product.

2-Create an object class for the shopping cart item to store the properties for product and its quantity.

3-To the preceding object class, add the method to calculate the total price of the item.

4-Create another object class for the shopping cart which contains an array of ShoppingCartItem instances.

    -Get the total of items inside the cart
    
    -Add items
